The timer program here can be used as a simple count-up stopwatch,
counting by default to 10 seconds.
However when somebody attempts to use it concurrently,
the second and subsequent instances produce an error.

You are asked to create a simple virtual runtime environment for this program,
in which it may be started successfully with unlimited number of concurrent
instances and unmodified executable code.

Program here is compiled for x86_64 libc6 linux.
